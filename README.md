### Disclaimer
From [projecteuler FAQ](https://projecteuler.net/about "Project Euler FAQ"):
```
I learned so much solving problem XXX so is it okay to publish my solution elsewhere?

It appears that you have answered your own question. There is nothing quite like that "Aha!" moment
when you finally beat a problem which you have been working on for some time.
It is often through the best of intentions in wishing to share our insights
so that others can enjoy that moment too. Sadly, however, that will not be the
case for your readers. Real learning is an active process and seeing how it is done
is a long way from experiencing that epiphany of discovery.
Please do not deny others what you have so richly valued yourself.
```

But actually if you search for any of these problems you will find 20+ answers in google.
This project is not intended to help those who can not get a problem but to show
how would I do it with my Python knowledge. In this way someone could learn from my
point of view or python syntax and I could learn from their feedback.
